# PR Autopilot — automated CR / Devin review-fix-merge loop

The autopilot runs the same loop I [@WuyangFF95] have been driving by hand
across PR#1 (6 rounds, 35 review items) and PR#12 (2 rounds, 28 review
items): read review comments → fix code → reply per-thread → wait for
re-review → repeat → squash-merge once `reviewDecision == APPROVED` AND
`mergeable == MERGEABLE`.

> **Status**: shipped in v0.1.3 PR#13. Three cost tiers — pick the one
> you want; the cheapest is always free.

## Cost tiers / 成本档位

The workflow runs in stages and **only escalates to a paid tier when
the cheaper tier didn't fully clear the round**. Configure as many
tiers as you want enabled.

工作流分档运行，**仅当便宜档没清完时才升档到收费档**。配多少档由你。

| Tier | Marginal cost | Setup | Coverage |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **0 · `apply_committable_suggestions.py`** | **$0** | None — runs always | CR / GitHub-native ```suggestion``` blocks (~50–80 % of round-1) |
| **1 · Claude Max OAuth** | **$0** if you already pay Max | `gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (extracted from `claude` CLI) | the residue Tier 0 didn't cover |
| **2 · Anthropic API key** | $0.5–$2 / round | `gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | same as Tier 1, pay-per-call |

If you have **none** of the secrets configured, Tier 0 still runs and
fixes whatever CR shipped a committable suggestion for. Anything
without a suggestion stays unaddressed for a human (or a future
configured tier) to handle.

未配置任何 secret 时，Tier 0 仍然运行并修复所有 CR 给了
committable suggestion 的项。没有 suggestion 的项保持未处理，留给
人工或后续配置的高档处理。

### Recommended setup

- **You pay for Claude Max** → set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` only.
  Marginal cost = $0; no per-API-call billing.
- **You don't pay for Max** → leave Tier 1 unconfigured; Tier 0 alone
  is free and clears most round-1 work; only set
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when you decide a particular PR is worth the
  $0.5–$2 escalation.

### How to get a Claude Max OAuth token

You don't need a separate setup. Two options, both official (per
[anthropics/claude-code-action setup docs](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/setup.md)):

**Option A — guided wizard (recommended)**

```bash
# Open Claude Code with your Max-authenticated session, then:
/install-github-app
```

This installs the Claude GitHub app on the repo, creates
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` as a repo secret, and wires the workflow
permissions in one go. Requires repo-admin on the target repo.

**Option B — manual `claude setup-token`**

```bash
# Anywhere with `claude` (Pro/Max) on PATH:
claude setup-token
# Copy the printed token, then in any shell with `gh` authenticated:
gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN \
    --repo WuyangFF95/CC_icons -b "<paste-token-here>"
```

The shell you run `gh secret set` in doesn't matter — it's a
GitHub-server-side store, not a local environment variable. macOS
`/Users/...`, Linux `/home/...`, GitHub Codespaces, anywhere works.

The OAuth token is bound to your Max account and has no separate
billing — it consumes the same quota you already pay for, with the
same fair-use limits.

PR Autopilot 自动化我（@WuyangFF95）在 PR#1（6 轮 35 评审项）和 PR#12（2
轮 28 评审项）手动跑的同一个循环：读评审 → 改代码 → 逐 thread 双语回复
→ 等再评 → 循环 → 在 `reviewDecision == APPROVED` + `mergeable == MERGEABLE`
时 squash-merge。

```

The fix step never decides on its own to merge; that requires a separate
event (the next CR/Devin review submission, or a human re-review) that
flips `reviewDecision` to `APPROVED`. This is intentional — the autopilot
gates merging on a real third-party review, not on its own judgement.

修复步骤永远不会自己决定合并；合并需要单独的事件（下次 CR/Devin 评审、
或人类重新评审）把 `reviewDecision` 翻成 `APPROVED`。这是有意的——
autopilot 把合并门控交给真正的第三方评审，不是它自己的判断。

## Setup

1. **Add the Anthropic API key** to this repo's secrets:

   ```bash
   gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -b "<your-key>"
   ```

2. **Verify** the workflow is enabled:

   ```bash
   gh workflow list
   gh workflow view "PR Autopilot"
   ```

3. **Test** on the next PR you open. The first run will dispatch on the
   `pull_request opened` event; subsequent runs trigger on
   `pull_request_review_comment` (CR / Devin reviews) and `synchronize`
   (your own pushes). Watch the Actions tab.

## Safety boundaries

The workflow embeds several hard rules:

- **`allow_paths` allowlist**: the autopilot can only touch
  `scripts/**`, `_journal-configs/**`, `_palettes/**`, `templates/**`,
  `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `.github/workflows/**`. Any patch that strays
  is rejected by the workflow's `Path guard` step (`git diff` against a
  baseline SHA captured before the fix step ran; out-of-scope edits
  cause `git reset --hard` and the job exits non-zero).
  Tier 0 enforces the same allow-list internally before writing any
  file, so a malicious / mis-aimed suggestion can't escape into
  unrelated trees in the first place.
- **No self-loop**: the `triage` job skips events from
  `github-actions[bot]` and `claude[bot]`, so the autopilot's own pushes
  and replies don't re-trigger it.
- **Concurrency lock**: per-PR group with `cancel-in-progress: false` —
  in-flight fix jobs always finish; new comments queue.
- **Draft PRs are skipped**: `triage` only runs when the PR is OPEN and
  not a draft. Mark a PR draft to pause the autopilot mid-cycle.
- **Hard rules in `scripts/autopilot_prompts/fix_round.md`**: never push
  to main, never force-push, never edit the autopilot itself, never
  create new files in user-curated content directories, leave threads
  alone if you don't know how to fix them.

## Limitations

- **API cost**: each fix round dispatches one Claude call with the bundled
  threads + repo context. PR#12's two rounds at this scale cost roughly
  $0.50–$2 each via Anthropic API; budget accordingly.
- **No live CodeRabbit free tier**: GitHub Actions still works on public
  repos free, but CR's review free tier rate-limits at ~5 PRs/month.
- **No automatic test execution**: the autopilot relies on syntax /
  CLI-help / template-validity smoke tests inside the prompt, not a real
  test suite. If your PR has tests, the workflow should be extended to
  run `pytest` after the fix step.
- **Single-actor concurrency**: two PRs reviewed in parallel will each
  spawn their own autopilot run. The concurrency group is per-PR.

## Manually triggering a run

Useful when CR / Devin missed a comment or the workflow file was edited:

```bash
gh workflow run "PR Autopilot" -f pr_number=42
```

## Operational tips

- Watch the first 2–3 autopilot runs closely. If it tries to fix
  something it shouldn't, mark the PR draft to pause; once paused, edit
  the relevant thread to add `[autopilot: skip]` and the next run will
  treat it as acknowledged.
- The autopilot logs its full classification reason every step. If a
  run no-ops unexpectedly, look at the `triage` job's stdout — it
  prints `should_run / mode / reason` together.

## Future work

- **Self-healing**: when the autopilot's own push fails CI (e.g. ruff /
  mypy), have it pull the failure log and dispatch another fix round
  on its own commit.
- **Cost cap**: a per-PR token budget that exits the workflow with a
  clear "budget exhausted, awaiting human" message.
- **Provider plurality**: drop in MiniMax / GLM-5.1 alongside Claude as
  alternative fix-providers (per the SKILL.md §1.0a routing logic for
  whole-figure SVG generation; the autopilot's fix pattern is
  similarly LLM-writes-code-directly).
